<p>Google has added a major update to its online spreadsheet program, Sheets, to include the ability to create and edit spreadsheets offline.Sheets, part of Googles Apps suite, has stood in the shadow of Microsoft Excel since its release.It has been hard pressed to measure up to one of the pillars of Microsofts vastly successful Office package.Google has been working on making alternatives to Microsofts flagships for some time, introducing programs Docs in 2007 and Slides in 2010.However its spreadsheet alternative still doesnt get recognition.</p>
