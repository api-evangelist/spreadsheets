<p>The Salesforce $1 Million Hackathon was incredibly exciting for us. It was awesome to see thousands of developers register and come to Dreamforce to hack. But, there have been some questions about the administration of the hackathon. We’ve seen questions about why the winning team was allowed to submit an app that may have used pre-existing code, how the judging worked, and the eligibility of participants. While we are conducting a thorough review of the final entries to ensure they complied with published rules and regulations, we wanted to address some of those concerns here.</p>
