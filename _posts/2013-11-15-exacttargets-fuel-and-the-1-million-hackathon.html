<p>My name is Ian Murdock, and I run the Platform product line at ExactTarget.As my team and I are gearing up for Dreamforce, I thought I’d take a few minutes and introduce ExactTarget and what we have in store for developers next week.ExactTarget helps many of the world’s top brands connect with their customers through highly-targeted, relevant communication across email, mobile, social media, and the web.Our flagship product, the ExactTarget Marketing Cloud, can be thought of as a “digital marketing operating system” that brings cross-channel marketing applications together in one place.The ExactTarget Marketing Cloud also provides a set of services that enable those applications to deeply integrate with each other through common messaging, calendaring, campaign management, and analytics frameworks.</p>
