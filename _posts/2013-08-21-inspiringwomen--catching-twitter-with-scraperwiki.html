<p>Those of you on twitter may have caught the recent #InspiringWomen hash tag, this was a response to the online abuse and threats received by many women in the public eye.On Sunday 4th August people tweeted about women who inspired them marking their tweets with the #InspiringWomen hashtag.#InspiringWomen was launched by my friend, @daintyballerina.In the aftermath she asked: how to capture all of these tweets?The problem being that the number of tweets (about 40,000) involved does not sit well with many online tools since they take a long time to download.</p>
