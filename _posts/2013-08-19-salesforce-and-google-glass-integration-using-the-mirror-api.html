<p>I’m pretty excited to be a part of the Google Glass Explorer program. Being in the Explorer program is like being one of the first users of the early Apple II: the tech is great and you can tell it’s just the tip of the wearable computing iceberg.There are multiple ways you can integrate with Glass using Google’s Mirror API, but they boil down to three options: sending data to Glass, use Glass to send data somewhere or a combination.The Mirror API is how you interact with Glass. Everyone can peruse the Mirror API docs, but you have to be specially authorized to have access to the API in the Google API console.</p>
