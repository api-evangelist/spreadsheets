<p>A tremendous amount of data is kept as CSVs, or Comma-Separated Values.Working with spreadsheets through programs like Google Spreadsheets can let you perform pretty magical calculations, but as the spreadsheet grows, it grinds your machine to a halt.Nevertheless, the ubiquity of the CSV means even tremendous files are kept that way.How can we make them easier to process?Enter orc-csv, a command-line tool for uploading CSVs to Orchestrate, bundled with a web server to work with them from your local machine.</p>
