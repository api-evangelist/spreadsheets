<p>Our recently announced OData connector gives Tableau users access to a world of unstructured and semi-structured data.In this post I’d like to demonstrate the power of a Python library, Pandas, and the Code in a Browser tool to get “live” stock market data from Yahoo!Finance into Tableau.Python is a well-established programming language with a rich ecosystem of software libraries which can provide access to a wide range of data.This isn’t a route to doing high frequency trading but it is a demonstrates the principles of using ScraperWiki as an adaptor to data on the web.</p>
