<p>We’re rolling out a series of performance improvements to ScraperWiki.Yesterday, we sped up the Tableau/OData connector.Today, it’s the turn of the humble CSV.When you go to “Download a spreadsheet” you’ll notice the CSV file is now always described as “live”.This means it is always up to date, and streams at full speed to your browser.</p>
