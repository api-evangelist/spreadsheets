<p>Have you ever wanted to collect data from many different pages on a website into one excel file or json object?You can use kimono’s targeted crawling capability to do just this and crawl thousands (or millions) of websites.‘Targeted crawling’ is perfect for scenarios where you are trying to grab the same data – e.g., prices, names, emails, descriptions, products – from several similarly structured web pages.</p>
