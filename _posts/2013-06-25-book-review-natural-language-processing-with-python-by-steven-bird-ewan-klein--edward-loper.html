<p>I bought Natural Language Processing in Python by Steven Bird, Ewan Klein & Edward Loper for a couple of reasons.Firstly, ScraperWiki are part of the EU Newsreader Project which seeks to make a “history recorder” using natural language processing to convert large streams of news articles into a more structured form.ScraperWiki’s role in this project is to scrape open sources of news related material, such as parliamentary records and to drive exploitation of the results of this work both commercially and through our contacts in the open source community.Although we’re not directly involved in the natural language processing work it seems useful to get a better understanding of the area.Secondly, I’ve recently given a talk at Data Science London, and my original interpretation of the brief was that I should talk a bit about natural language processing.</p>
