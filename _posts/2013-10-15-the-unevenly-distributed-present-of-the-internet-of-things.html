<p>I am often reminded of William Gibson’s famous quote, “The future is already here — it’s just not very evenly distributed.” Many of us carry super computers in our pockets, some of us wear insanely powerful machines on our heads (and look great doing it BTW) and others are deep into their personal Internet of Things (IOT) journey.I’ve been putting together a developer facing IOT experience for Dreamforce, and so I’ve been looking around about that last category quite a bit. Developers thinking about the Internet of Things fall, broadly speaking, into one of three camps: newbies, bilinguals or revolutionaries. I estimate these to be approximately 90%, 9% and 1% of developers, respectively.</p>
