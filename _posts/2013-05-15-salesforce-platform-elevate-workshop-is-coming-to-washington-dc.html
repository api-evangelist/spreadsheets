<p>Our journey to ELEVATE the skills of developer and partner communities continues with our next stop, Salesforce Platform ELEVATE  in Washington DC. Salesforce Platform ELEVATE, is a FREE, one-day, hands-on developer workshop designed to teach beginner and advanced developers how to build cloud applications on the Salesforce Platform.For Washington DC, we are adding a third track to help entrepreneurs looking to build their next big enterprise app for either the commercial or public sector markets.As a new developer, you’ll learn step-by-step how to quickly build a cloud app while learning the foundations of the platform in this hands-on tutorial.By the end of the workshop you’ll be able to create an app using point-and-click development and extend your app using Visualforce Apex Code.</p>
