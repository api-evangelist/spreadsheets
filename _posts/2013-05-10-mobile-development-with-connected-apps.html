<p>With last month’s announcement of Salesforce Mobile Services, the company introduced ten services that included Social, Identity, Trust, Geolocation, and Data services (both customer and offline).At the core of these services is a new feature, Connected Apps, that has until now only  been available in a pilot program for new development orgs.However, Connected Apps will become generally available with the release of Summer ’13.So what exactly are Connected Apps?A “Connected App” is an external application that can securely connect to Force.</p>
