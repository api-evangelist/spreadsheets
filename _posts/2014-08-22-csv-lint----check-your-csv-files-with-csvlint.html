<p>CSV looks easy, but it can be hard to make a CSV file that other people can read easily.CSVLint helps you to check that your CSV file is readable.And you can use it to check whether it contains the columns and types of values that it should.Just enter the location of the file you want to check, or upload it.If you have a schema which describes the     contents of the CSV file, you can also give its URL or upload it.</p>
