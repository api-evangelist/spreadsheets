<p>A hackathon is a very focused way to gain experience on our platforms in a short space of time. At the recent Hacked event in London we had lots of 500 developers present asking all sorts of questions about the Heroku and Force.com platforms. As the hackathon produced lots of custom customer facing apps, much of the development was done using the Heroku platform. If these apps are developed commercially, then the data they create is a natural fit to be managed by a Force.</p>
