<p>The AsyncListener API allows you to have callbacks executed over the life cycle of an asynchronous callback.This allows you to solve a number of problems like storing transaction ids, having long stack traces, and profiling asynchronous functions.In this post I’m going to dive into the AsyncListener API, answer a few common questions, and introduce you to how it works.In a previous post I talked about preserving data across asynchronous callbacks.If you haven’t read it, it talks about how to store a transaction id for every request and then automatically add the transaction id to every log message.</p>
