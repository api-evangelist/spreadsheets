<p>ScraperWiki is about liberating data from silos and empowering you to do what you want with it.You can either write your own code, or use our powerful built-in tools…
 
 …And there’ll be more coming.Like one for opening up your data on CKAN, and one for magically scraping tabular data.If you’re a developer, you can write your own tools using git, SSH and any language you like.We’ve safely moved all of the existing scrapers and views from ScraperWiki Classic to classic.</p>
