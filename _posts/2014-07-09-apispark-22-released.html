In light of all the summer festivities, sport events and buzzing bees, we recently released version 2.2 of APISpark.We think that’s pretty exciting as this version includes: 
This new Swagger integration in APISpark lets you display the Swagger UI and embed it in your developer portal.Basically, any web API that you create using APISpark now automatically maintains and hosts an up-to-date Swagger JSON definition.It works for manually crafted APIs as well as those generated based on APISpark data stores (such as a local Cassandra database, an external SQL database, a Google Spreadsheet, a Parse or Firebase backend).</p>
