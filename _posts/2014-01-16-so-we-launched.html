<p>We want to thank everyone for the amazing response and support during our (beta) launch.It’s been a busy 24 hours interacting with as many of you as we can, seeing an explosion in user signups and APIs / Apps created.We’re super excited that you all like it as much as we do.There are some important things we want to say now that this has gone into full swing: 
First, we know kimono doesn’t work everywhere, and that some percentage of the sites that you’ve been trying it on don’t produce reliable results, or in some cases fail to even create an API.When kimono fails a support ticket is automatically created for us and we are tracking different sites to determine what the problem is.</p>
