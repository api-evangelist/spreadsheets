<p>I’ve been at Salesforce for about 6 years now where I work every day with our developer community building apps.I spend a LOT of time at Hackathons, whether it is a Salesforce run event, or other company/product/technology.I’ve won a few, lost a bunch, met great people, and learned a hell of a lot along the way.Perhaps the biggest learning of all is that the most important part of any hackathon is the 2-3 minutes you and your team have to pitch the judges.Unfortunately, time and time again, I notice that teams do not spend enough time preparing for this part of the hackathon.</p>
