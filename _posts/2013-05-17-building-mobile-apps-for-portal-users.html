<p>Back in February, I blogged about how web applications can use OAuth to obtain a token and access the Force.com API on behalf of Portal users; I’ve had a couple of questions on how to build mobile apps that do the same, so here are the details.I’m going to assume that you’ve set up a portal , its  associated Force.com Site ,  written a custom login page and its controller in Visualforce and Apex , and  set it as the ‘Authorization Required Page’ for the Site  ( here’s a step-by-step tutorial  I wrote on the topic last year that will walk you through the details).As I mentioned in  that earlier post , your Portal users must have the ‘API Enabled’ permission on their profile.</p>
