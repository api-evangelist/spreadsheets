<p>First of all, let me just say that as a newbie to the API arena, I found this conference to be full of valuable information and extremely rich in content.There were many industry-leading speakers.Jérôme Louvel, CEO of Restlet, was a speaker for the first day of the event and had wonderful turnout for his speech “Web APIs, the New Language Frontier”.He also announced the public beta of APISpark, more details are coming in another blog post!If you missed it or are interested in reviewing the slides again, you can find them here:

 The second and last day was a little less restless (pun intended – excuse me, as a non-tech person, this is probably the only one accessible to me!</p>
