<p>Limits can be annoying.Who am I to tell you how many Justin Bieber videos you can stream in a week or how many croissants you can eat today?However, to maintain optimum performance for all our customers, salesforce.com balances transaction loads by imposing limits, such as the total API requests per 24-hour period for an organization.We realize that this creates another condition that you must handle in your code when you use the Force.</p>
