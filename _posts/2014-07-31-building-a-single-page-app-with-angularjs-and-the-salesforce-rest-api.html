<p>Guest postÂ David is co-founder of Aerobatic, a cloud hosting platform optimized for single page HTML5 applications.More than ever it is possible to build sophisticated web applications using nothing more than the technologies available in the browser, namely Javascript, HTML, and CSS.In this post I will walk through the process of building and testing a single page contact manager application with AngularJS and the Salesforce REST API.The sample app is hosted on the Aerobatic cloud platform which is highly specialized for just this sort of HTML5 / REST API application.While nearly all of the code will work without modification as static files on their own, Aerobatic provides an enhanced platform that further streamlines the delivery of single page apps including: a smart API proxy, simulator mode that eliminates test environments, traffic routing, automatic CDN hosting, and more.</p>
