<p>Everyone says Twitter Bootstrap makes front-end web development faster and easier, but how can we prove that?Below is a video of a simple Visualforce page being converted into a responsive, mobile first web page in a little over 3 minutes and covers the foundation for setting up a bootstrap project natively on Force.com.Nice demo, but one thing to consider is this will only work with the header off.If you try to include bootstrap in a vf page  with a header salesforce styles will get messed up.</p>
