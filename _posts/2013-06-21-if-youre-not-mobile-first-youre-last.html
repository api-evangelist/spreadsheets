<p>Mobile has changed the way we live and increasingly is changing the way we work. Users want and expect information to be easy to interact with and consume whether that’s a text from Mom or an expense report from their employee. They live in “micro-moments,” consuming smaller bits of data more frequently across their day, rather than sitting for marathon sessions in front of a laptop.What does this mean for you as an ISV?Massive opportunity.</p>
