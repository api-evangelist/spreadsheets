<p>The Salesforce Platform enables ISVs to rapidly build enterprise mobile apps with our Platform Mobile Services.You can innovate even faster by leveraging our Mobile Packs and Mobile SDKs.In this blog post we will show you how to further enhance your mobile app and make it enterprise-grade by using a managed package.Most prosumer apps are not enterprise-grade 
Listing your app on the AppExchange and various app stores lets you reach a wide audience.Most often these will be “prosumers,” or power users who are actively browsing for apps to improve their productivity.</p>
