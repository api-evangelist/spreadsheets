<p>This (long) post is in response to the blog post by Tom Slee, titled  “Why the Open Data Movement is a Joke.” Every once in a while, an article that dismisses Open Data as irrelevant, a joke, or a pipe dream catches our imagination and compels us to chime in, even though thoughtful people we respect like David Eaves, Alex Howard and Tom Lee have already weighed in on the issue (here, here and here, respectively).Some people might dismiss our views as self-serving and profit-motivated.We are after all, a for-profit technology start-up that has chosen to focus on enabling Open Data from a technology standpoint, by providing a turnkey, purpose-built, cloud-based platform that government organizations around the world use to share their data.Or, one might consider that we are a team of people who care that our technology enables positive change.</p>
