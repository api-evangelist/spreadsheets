<p>Key Quotes from Java API Copyright Case between Oracle and Google				May 17, 2014 	 	Posted by Jerome Louvel in Android, Ecosystem, Google, Oracle, Restlet General.trackback 				  	
After the shock wave following the recent legal decision at Federal level on the Java copyright case between Oracle and Google, I decided to read the 69 pages of the court decision and extract the most interesting quotes, from a Java technologist point of view.Quote 1 – Scope 
This copyright dispute involves 37 packages of computer source code.The parties have often referred to these groups of computer programs, individually or collectively, as “application programming interfaces,” or API packages, but it is their content, not their name, that matters.” 
Quote 2 – On patents 
The jury found no patent infringement, and the patent claims are not at issue in this appeal.</p>
