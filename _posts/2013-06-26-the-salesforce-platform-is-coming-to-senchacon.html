<p>Smart phones and tablets are taking over.Mobile devices keep getting faster and more powerful, approaching PCs in processing capabilities and often exceeding in usability and convenience.Mobile apps are fueling this trend, and  the increasing maturity of JavaScript, AJAX with responsive UI, and mobile web development as a whole are just a few signs that JavaScript is eating the world.As application development continues to become increasingly mobile-first, the Salesforce Platform needs to mirror this shift.As such, we have Salesforce Platform Mobile Services which are a set of tools, frameworks, and APIs to help you rapidly build enterprise mobile apps for any device.</p>
