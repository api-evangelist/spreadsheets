<p>API Commons integration in APISpark				May 6, 2014 	 	Posted by Swann Vichot in APISpark, Restlet General.trackback 				  	
Today we are really happy to announce the integration of API Commons into the APISpark platform.The integration specs are explained further below, but for those who aren’t familiar with the project, here’s a little more details!The API Commons initiative was started by Kin Lane, API Evangelist, and Steven Wilmott, CEO at 3SCale.We both felt like there should be a place where API providers could publish the API designs, defined using emerging API definition formats like API Blueprint, RAML and Swagger, and take a stance on the copyright of their API design, using the Creative Commons license of their choice.</p>
