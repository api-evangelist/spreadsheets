<p>A very common need is to geocode data in a Google Spreadsheet (for example, in creating TimeMaps with the Timeliner project).There are several options here:
 By hand – use a Geocoding service (see the previous post) and then copy and paste by hand.Use the ImportXML (or ImportCSV) formulae to grab data from a geocoding service – great but with limitations on the number of rows you can code at one time (~50).Use a Google App Script – the most powerful but requires installation of an App Script in your spreadsheet.In this tutorial I’m going to cover the latter two automated options and specifically focus on option 2.</p>
