<p>Y Combinator’s investments over the past decade have led to a portfolio of companies valued at north of $30bn, speaking to the incubator’s ability to identify high-value ideas and industries on the rise.On demo day for the Summer 2014 batch last Tuesday, we were struck by the mix of problems that these companies are looking to solve and how different it looks from a decade ago (remember when daily deals were a thing?) As a bellwether for industries on the rise (and maybe a clue as to where we should invest our rainy day funds…) we decided to get some data and take a closer look at where (and why) YC is investing now.We used kimono to quickly create three APIs capturing publicly available data to answer this question.See the APIs here, here and here.</p>
