<p>A while back I wrote a blog post called Salesforce APIs – What They Are & When to Use Them.Since then, we’ve been hard at work here at Salesforce and there are some new APIs to tell you about. So I sat down once again with Pat Patterson, Developer Evangelist Architect with Salesforce, to talk about these new additions to the integration tool box.D: Pat, thanks for talking with me today.It’s been a while since we last talked about Salesforce APIs.</p>
