<p>Inspired by my long commute and the pretty dreadful EDM music blasting out in my gym, I’ve found myself on a bit of a podcast kick lately.Besides my usual NPR fare (If you’ve not yet listened to an episode of This American Life with Ira Glass, you’ve missed out), I’ve been checking out the Stack Exchange podcast; a fairly irreverent take on the popular Q & A website hosted by the founders.On the 51st episode, they announced the opening of their latest site which focuses on the exciting world of open data.Perhaps the most common complaint I’ve heard since I’ve started surrounding myself with data scientists is that getting specific sets of data can be frustratingly hard.Often, you will find that what you can get by scraping from a website is more than sufficient.</p>
