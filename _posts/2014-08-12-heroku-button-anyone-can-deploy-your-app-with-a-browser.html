<p>Heroku Button provides an easy way for anyone to deploy your apps, for free, with just a browser. This encourages others to give meaningful feedback on your apps and greater incentive to get involved with your projects.To use Heroku Button, simply create a manifest file for your app and add the Heroku Button code to your Github repository or Website. Heroku takes care of the rest (server, database, deployment, scaling etc).app.</p>
