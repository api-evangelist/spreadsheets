<p>Do you remember what inspired you to start coding?Whether you’re a developer by trade, hobby, or maybe you don’t even identify as a developer, there is probably some tangible experience that catalyzed your app building journey.The match that lit my coding flame was a C++ class I took back in high school when I made my first calculator amongst other things like hangman or tic-tac-toe.Experiences like these can change the way a person thinks and what they think they are capable of doing.Along that same vein, this week was Computer Science Education Week which is an annual program dedicated to inspiring K-12 students interests in computer science.</p>
