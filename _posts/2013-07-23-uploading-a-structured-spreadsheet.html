<p>We’ve made a new tool to help you upload a structured spreadsheet.That is to say, one that contains a table with headers.I’m trying it out with an old spreadsheet of expenses from when I worked at mySociety.If your spreadsheet isn’t consistent enough, it tells you where you’ve gone wrong.In my case, I didn’t have a clear header.</p>
