<p>With the recently announced Mobile Pack for Appery.io, Exadel has made it easy and to quickly build enterprise mobile apps connected to its Salesforce API. Appery.io is a cloud-based platform with visual development tools and integrated backend services, and we’ve created two plug-ins that make it super easy to connect to Salesforce Platform. Everything runs in the cloud, which means there is nothing to install or download.</p>
