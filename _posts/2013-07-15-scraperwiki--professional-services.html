<p>You could use ScraperWiki to write and host you own computer code that carries out the scraping you need, and then use our other self-service tools to clean and analyse the data.But sometimes writing your own code is not a feasible solution.Perhaps your organisation does not have the coding skills in the required area.Or maybe an internal team needs support to deploy their own solutions, or lacks the time and resources to get the job done quickly.That’s why, alongside our new platform, ScraperWiki also offers a professional service specifically tailored to corporate customers’ needs.</p>
