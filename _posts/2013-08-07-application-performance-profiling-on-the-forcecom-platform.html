<p>If you’ve developed your own application, you might feel like you’re in a thrilling, made-for-TV competition with your users: Who can find the performance hotspots first?Your users don’t actually know that they’re in this race, but when they “win” it and encounter a slow-loading Visualforce page, for example, they lose valuable time, and your application loses cachet.But when you win—and identify and fix performance hotspots early on—something special happens: Your users also win.The tricky part comes here: How can you win a race if you don’t know where the finish line or the obstacles in front of it are?You can train for it.</p>
