<p>Surely everyone likes things on maps?Driven by this thought we’re produced a new tool for the ScraperWiki Platform: an importer for GeoJSON.GeoJSON is a file format for encoding geographic information.It is based on JSON which is popular for web based APIs because it is light weight, flexible and easy to parse by JavaScript – the language that powers the interactive web.We envisage the GeoJSON importer being handy to visualise geographic data, and export that data to software like Tableau using our OData connector.</p>
