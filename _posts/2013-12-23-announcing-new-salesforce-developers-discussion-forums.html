<p>Today we’re excited to announce the new Salesforce Developers Discussion Forums.We’ve listened to your feedback on how we can improve the forums. With Chatter Answers, built on the Salesforce1 Platform, we were able to implement an entirely new experience, integrated with the rest of the Salesforce Developers site. By the way, it’s also mobile-friendly.We’ve migrated all the existing data, including user accounts.</p>
