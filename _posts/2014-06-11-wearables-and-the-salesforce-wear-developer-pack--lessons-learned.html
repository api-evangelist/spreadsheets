<p>Yesterday, we released the Salesforce Wear Developer Pack – a set of open-source starter apps that let you quickly design and build wearable apps that connect to the Salesforce1 Platform.The pack includes sample/reference apps for six wearable devices – Google Glass, Android Wear, Samsung Gear 2, Myo, Nymi and Pebble Watch.In each case, we’ve built a fully functional end-to-end app that connects securely to the Salesforce1 Platform to query and/or update customer data.Behind every one of these devices is a customer, and the Wear Pack makes it easier for developers to build apps that interact with that customer.It’s not often that you get to build apps for six different wearable devices (trying my hand at the art of British understatement).</p>
