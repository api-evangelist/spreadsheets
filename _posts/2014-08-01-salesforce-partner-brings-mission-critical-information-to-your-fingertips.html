<p>Mission Critical Information Management (MCIM) powered by Fulcrum is a Salesforce1 Mobile App that is not your typical Independent Service Vendor (ISV).Our application empowers national or global enterprises with the ability to manage, evaluate, and report on critical infrastructure with the click (or tap) of a button.The release of the Salesforce1 Platform allowed us to deliver an already invaluable application directly into the hands of users in the field.From Asset Monitoring (Equipment Rounds) to Preventative Maintenance Work Orders, the power of mobility for MCIM is massive.What exactly do we do?</p>
