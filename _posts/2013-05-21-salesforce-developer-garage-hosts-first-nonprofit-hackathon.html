<p>Salesforce Developer Garage is a FREE developer event that allows the developer community to come together to hack, learn from experts and exchange ideas.As part of Developer Garage, we recently held the Salesforce Nonprofit hackathon in San Francisco, which brought together Salesforce Foundation, Salesforce Nonprofits and Salesforce employees together to build cloud applications that could be used by selected nonprofit organizations.The vision behind the hackathon was to help each non-profit solve a specific problem that the organization faced.Organizations were selected with the help of Steve Andersen, SVP of Technology & Innovation at Salesforce Foundation, and included Alliance for Climate Education, Net Impact and Health Leads.Each nonprofit submitted requirements to which the following use cases were created:
 Alliance for Climate Education:Â Help ACE share data between two climate education organizations as their supporters transition from one to the other.</p>
