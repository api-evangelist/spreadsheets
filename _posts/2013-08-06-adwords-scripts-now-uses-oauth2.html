<p>We are glad to announce that AdWords scripts now uses OAuth2 for authorization.In addition to streamlining the authorization flow, this change also increases the limit of number of scripts per user to 250.When you create a new script, you will be prompted to authorize the script to access your account on your behalf.When you click the “Authorize Now” button, a “Request for Permission” dialog that lists the Google services required by your script will be displayed.You can review and grant the requested permissions to authorize the script.</p>
