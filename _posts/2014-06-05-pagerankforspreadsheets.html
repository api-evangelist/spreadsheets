<p>These are materials for my talk at SEMS.Blockquotes, code blocks, and images will be slides projected for everyone to see, and everything else is things that I’ll say.For the past few years, I’ve been hearing a lot about “open data”.I was apparently even an expert in open data even though I didn’t really know what it was.So I started going to various repositories of open data, downloading all of the data, and looking at what they contained.</p>
