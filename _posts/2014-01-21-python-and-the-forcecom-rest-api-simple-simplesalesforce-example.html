<p>Many, many, many moons ago I posted about writing an Insanely Simple Python Script that used the Salesforce REST API’s. It was a great little example, updated later by Mr.Pat Patterson and eventually evolved into a longer script that I used for demonstrations. Due to bad source control and a new laptop build, I recently lost the code to said longer script – but I still wanted a similar demo. While losing code is a bummer, I always say that when life throws you lost code you hand life back new refactored code.</p>
