<p>We recently made 37 dashboards for GOV.UK, full of stats about what people look at on the Government’s website.As you know, the best data opens itself, so I asked myself, what does the underlying data behind these new dashboards secretly reveal?Each dashboard shows the devices people used to access a department.If you mush that together across all the departments, I asked myself, which one do people most read from mobile phones?</p>
