<p>I started working on the AppExchange in 2007, before the Apple App Store existed and before any of us had a phone that could tell you the weather or hail you a taxi.  It was the wild wild west of apps back then and we all knew we are on to something, we just didn’t know how big that something would be.Flash forward 6 years to last week and I am sitting in a conference room with the team obsessively refreshing my browser to watch the AppExchange ticker blow past 2M enterprise installs. Amongst the high fives and hamburgers, it was a monumental day for the team and something I think we’ll all remember for years to come.While the AppExchange has been a great broker for apps in the enterprise, the true success lies in our partners.</p>
