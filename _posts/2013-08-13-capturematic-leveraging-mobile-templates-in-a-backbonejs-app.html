<p>Capturematic (GitHub repo) is an iOS app that lets you post a photo, audio or video to any Salesforce record with a Chatter feed; it’s a great example of a simple hybrid mobile app that accesses device functionality – in this case, the camera and microphone.You can see the app in action in this short video:
 
 Capturematic uses Cordova to access device features and Backbone.js as a model/view framework, but in this blog entry I’ll focus on the new Salesforce Mobile Templates, which provide the app with a modern mobile look-and-feel. At present, Capturematic is only available as source code, but I may submit it to the AppStore if there is sufficient demand.Capturematic’s source is located in a single file, index.</p>
