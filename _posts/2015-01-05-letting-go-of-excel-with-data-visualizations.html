<p>Data analysts and business professionals globally rely on Microsoft Excel spreadsheets to capture, organize, and analyze information.As the industry standard for managing key business performance metrics reports, Excel has historically served as the platform where assessments and business decisions begin to form.With the emergence of new modern, mobile-first, web-based analytics platforms, Excel will no longer be the mainstay primary resource, and instead, may likely become a secondary tool for insights.Going forward, larger volumes of structured data will be analyzed and then exported to Excel for more flexible ad-hoc uses.While Excelâ€™s interface permits an individual of almost any skill level to work with data, it is not the ideal tool for storing and analyzing granular data such commerce transactions which can number in the millions daily for supermarkets and other fast moving consumer goods retailers.</p>
