<p>Uber is one of my favorite mobile apps.Not only is it a great concept (“Everyone’s Private Driver”), but the app also has a great UI and UX experience (yes, they are different).It asks for the absolute minimum user input and infers the rest via a combination of the mobile context (current location) and some backend data (payment options etc).The UI/UX for the average enterprise mobile app is a far cry from the high bar set by consumer focused apps like Uber.It doesn’t and shouldn’t have to be that way.</p>
