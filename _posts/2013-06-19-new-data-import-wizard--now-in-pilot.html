<p>The new Data Import Wizard — in pilot as of Summer ’13 — provides a unified interface that lets you import and/or update a number of standard Salesforce objects, including accounts, contacts, leads, and solutions.The wizard also lets you import and update custom objects.You don’t have to pick and choose between different wizards in Setup anymore.Now you can do it all in one place!Note: The separate import wizards for accounts, contacts, leads, solutions, and custom objects will remain available, unchanged in functionality, for the foreseeable future.</p>
