<p>When I launched the Restlet open source project on TheServerSide in 2005 as a consultant, I didn’t know how far this could lead me, but I knew Restlet Framework was the first of its kind, true to the principles of the Web (the REST architecture style published in 2000).It changed the way Java developers can build and consume web applications & sites, without forcing previous paradigms such as RPC and MVC into a web “pipe” or artificial separating web server (think Servlet) and web client (think Apache HTTP client) technologies.After many  iterations, we reached version 1.0 and transformed Noelios as a company in 2008 with my co-founder Thierry Boileau to offer professional services.This allowed us to fund the R&D effort on Restlet, dedicate time to the writing of ‘Restlet in Action’ book and refine our ROA/D methodology.</p>
