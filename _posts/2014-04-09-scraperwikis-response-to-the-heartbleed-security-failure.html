<p>On Monday the 7th of April 2014, a software flaw was identified which exposed approximately two thirds of the web to the risk of catastrophic security failure.The flaw has been dubbed “Heartbleed“.The potential for exploiting this has now been mitigated by many providers, including ScraperWiki.The ramifications are only slowly becoming understood.We at ScraperWiki recommend that you change your passwords on all websites of importance to you, especially with your bank, email and anything that can be used to impersonate you; regardless of whether you have used those passwords anywhere else.</p>
