<p>The kimono chrome extension significantly expands the number of websites that you can extract data from and enhances the quality and reliability of your API’s page fetches.Add the kimono chrome from our website.Don’t worry, we still fully support the kimonify bookmarklet for those of you who don’t want to make the switch, but keep in mind you will need the chrome extension to create auth APIs.</p>
