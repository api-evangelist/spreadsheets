<p>The US Securities and Exchange Commission’s investigation into JP Morgan Chase’s hiring practices in Asia took a more serious turn with a Bloomberg News report that the bank kept a spreadsheet of well-connected hires from prominent families, linked to specific deals the bank was pursuing.As Quartz has reported, US regulators investigating the bank for violation of the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act will be looking for specific evidence that links JP Morgan’s hires with specific deals it was pursuing—like, say, a spreadsheet that lays out those connections in detail.While Bloomberg doesn’t specify, the spreadsheet is almost certainly created in Excel, a program that financial firms rely on so constantly that even when they’re not at work, bankers can’t stop using it (like this guy, who created a spreadsheet for women he was dating and had “in the pipeline”).At this point, JP Morgan’s legal compliance and top executives, as well as a slew of government officials and executives around the world, may wish they’d never heard of Excel.It has been linked to a series of missteps and blowups, including:
 The “London Whale” trade
 Due to an error in an Excel spreadsheet used to model risk, JP Morgan seriously underestimated the downside of its synthetic credit portfolio, which ultimately led to the bank to declare $6 billion in losses and could lead to another $600 million in fines.</p>
