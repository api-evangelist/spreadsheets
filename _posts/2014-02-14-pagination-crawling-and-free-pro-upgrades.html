<p>Pagination: Kimono can now extract full data sets from web sites with content that is split up across different pages, e.g., a catalog with 100 products, only 20 of which are visible on a page.Kimono follows links to the next page to get additional data from subsequent pages. Watch tutorial video
Targeted crawling: Our new crawler gets content from multiple pages that share similar structure.</p>
