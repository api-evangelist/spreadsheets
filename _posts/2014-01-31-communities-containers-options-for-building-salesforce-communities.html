<p>With the Summer ‘13 release of Salesforce Communities, we’ve started to provide our customers with a powerful set of tools to engage people outside their organization: consumers, customers, prospects, resellers, partners, integrators, dealers, and other constituencies.But every business has a unique set of constituencies with a unique set of needs.Our legacy partner and customer portals were largely used as vertically-oriented process portals: they were set up for a specific purpose (customer self-service, origination of high-touch service, and channel pipeline tracking), and the primary engagement tools involved either maintenance of data and process (logging cases, registering leads, etc) as well as searching for relevant information to resolve issues or to accomplish a specific purpose (knowledge, content).And although the communities technology starts with the familiar setup and configuration of portals, adding great collaboration tools like Chatter, Ideas, and Q&A and powerful web content capabilities from Site.com takes Salesforce Communities from a simple process portal and makes it into a powerful engagement platform.</p>
