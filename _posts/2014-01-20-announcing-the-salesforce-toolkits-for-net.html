<p>Salesforce provides programmatic access to your organizationâ€™s information using simple, powerful, and secure application programming interfaces (APIs).APIs open up a platform to developers and enable them to explore different ways to integrate platform capabilities within their own applications.To simplify the life of the developer, many APIs are accompanied by software development kits (commonly called SDKs) and toolkits that provide libraries and resources for interacting with the API.Some good examples for Salesforce are the Salesforce Mobile SDK (for Native, Hybrid, and HTML5) and the Force.com JavaScript REST Toolkit.</p>
