<p>I’ve always thought of the London Underground as a sort of teleportation system.You enter a portal in one place, and with relatively little effort appeared at a portal in another place.Although in Star Trek our heroes entered a special room and stood well-separated on platforms, rather than packing themselves into metal tubes.I read Christian Wolmar’s book, The Subterranean Railway about the history of the London Underground a while ago.At the time I wished for a visualisation for the growth of the network since the text description was a bit confusing.</p>
