<p>A little over a month ago, we released a version of the CrunchBase dataset in a simple Excel spreadsheet.Why?We wanted to make CrunchBase more accessible and give everyone a chance to run their own analysis.After receiving tons of positive feedback, we’ve decided to release monthly updates because the dataset keeps growing.In May, nearly 10k users made over 43k edits to the database and data keeps flowing in from the CrunchBase Venture Program which now includes over 160 venture firms, angel groups, and incubators.</p>
