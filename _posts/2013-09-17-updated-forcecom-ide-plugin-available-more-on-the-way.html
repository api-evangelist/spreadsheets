<p>We have repaired a bug around a new metadata type â€“ InstalledPackages.Some of you were unable to save anything if you had done some mods to the package.xml file, and some of you were having trouble with normal deployments due to some unique aspects of this new metadata type.(Please see the end of the post for some additional details.) These troubles should be fixed.</p>
