<p>In a recent post I showed how to use the ScraperWiki Twitter Search Tool to capture tweets for analysis.I demonstrated this using a search on the #InspiringWomen hashtag, using Tableau to generate a visualisation.Here Iâ€™m going to show a tool made using the R statistical programming language which can be used to view any Twitter Search dataset.R is very widely used in both academia and industry to carry out statistical analysis.It is open source and has a large community of users who are actively developing new libraries with new functionality.</p>
