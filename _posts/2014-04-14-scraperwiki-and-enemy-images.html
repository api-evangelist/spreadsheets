<p>This is a guest blog post by Elizaveta Gaufman, a researcher and lecturer at the University of Tübingen.The theme of my PhD dissertation is enemy images in contemporary Russia.However, I am not only interested in the governmental rhetoric which is relatively easy to analyse, but also in the way enemy images are circulating on the popular level.As I don’t have an IT background I was constantly looking for easy-to-use tools that would help me analyse the data from social networks, which for me represent a sort of a petri dish of social experimentation.Before I came across ScraperWiki I had to use a bunch of separate tools to analyse data: I had to scrape the data with one tool, then visualise it with another and ultimately create word clouds with the most frequently used terms with a third tool.</p>
