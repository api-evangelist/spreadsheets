<p>We’ve tried hard, but sadly we are not able to bring back our Twitter data tools.Simply put, this is because Twitter have no route to market to sell low volume data for spreadsheet-style individual use.It’s happened to similar services in the past, and even to blog post instructions.There’s lots of confusion in the market about the exact rules, and why they happen.This blog post tries to explain them clearly!</p>
