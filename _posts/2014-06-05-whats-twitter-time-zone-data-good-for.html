<p>The Twitter friends tool has just been improved to retrieve the time zone of users.This is actually more useful than it first might sound.If you’ve looked at Twitter profiles before, you’ve probably noticed that users can, and sometimes do, enter anything they like as their location.Looking at @ScraperWiki‘s followers, we can see from a small snippet of users that this can sometimes give us messy data:.Denver.</p>
