<p>Why run a hackathon 
Hackathons are a great way to learn from the experiences of other developers and expand your skills effectively. They are also a great way to innovate around ideas and do some out of the box thinking. Innovation is one reason companies get involved, they want developers to get creative and inspire people to build valuable apps and services. So both you and your company benefit by being involved in hackathons.You don’t have to start off with a 500 developer hackathon, just getting 10 developers together can be a great start.</p>
