<p>When we started work on the ScraperWiki beta, we decided to host it ‘in the cloud’ using Linode, a PaaS (Platform as a Service) provider.For the uninitiated, Linode allows people to host their own virtual Linux servers without having to worry about things like maintaining their own hardware.On April 15th 2013, Linode were hacked via a ColdFusion zero-day exploit.The hackers were able to access some of Linode’s source code, one of their web servers, and notably, their customer database.In a blog post released the next day, they assured us that all the credit card details they store are encrypted.</p>
