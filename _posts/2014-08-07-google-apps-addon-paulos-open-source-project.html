<p>When we released the Octopart Excel add-in a couple of months ago, we were pleasantly surprised by warm feedback from lots of people who do not use Excel.Overwhelmingly, people asked us when were going to support an add-on for Google Docs.One of them - our new friend Paulo Henrique Silva - took it to the next level and built it for everyone:
Now you can access sourcing information for your electronic components directly from your Google spreadsheet!This Google Docs Add-on is an open source project so the code is available and extensible on Github.Give it a whirl and let us know what you think.</p>
