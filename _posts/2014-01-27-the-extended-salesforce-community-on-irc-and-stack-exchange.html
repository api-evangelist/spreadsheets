<p>Two years ago, my colleague Pat Patterson (aka @metadaddy) reported on the Salesforce Internet Relay Chat (IRC) channel.Given how active this community is, I thought it was worth a redux post to raise awareness again.As developer evangelists, one of our roles is to stay connected with the developer community.I have to say that one of the best ways I have found to do that these days is through the salesforce IRC channel.On any given day, there are 20-50 people actively discussing, debating, and in general hashing out all things salesforce.</p>
