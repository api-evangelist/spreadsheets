<p>Not to beat a dead llama, but I was away for a little while, remember? Before I left, mobile was “coming soon”, and I’ll admit that I wasn’t paying much attention (yes, even though I had seen Mary Meeker present her Internet Trends IN PERSON at a Salesforce management event in March 2010 and say “Mobile Will Be Bigger Than Desktop Internet in 5 Years” – heck, I figured I had some time). When I came back from South America in May, mobile had arrived! 2 years early! It was time to get on board.</p>
