<p>A few weeks ago I started messing around with different Javascript libraries and put them up on Github as the Javascript Playground.Well, lo and behold, it turns out I wasn’t the only one curious about some of these.Lot’s of people are working in the area.In fact, one person has gone so far as to share their very excellent code with the project.Kevin Poorman, aka @CodeFriar on Twitter and IRC, has created a very flexible “ngForce” library.</p>
