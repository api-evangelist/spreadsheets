<p>With a second tube strike scheduled for Tuesday I thought I should provide a useful little tool to help travellers cope!It is not obvious from the tube map but London Underground stations can be surprisingly close together, very well within walking distance.Using this tool, you can select a tube station and the map will show you those stations which are within a mile and a half of it.1.5 miles is my definition of a reasonable walking distance.</p>
