<p>Following our popular tool which makes it easy to scrape and download tweets, we’re pleased to announce a new one to get any Twitter account’s followers.To use it, log into ScraperWiki, choose “Create a new dataset” then pick the tool
 
 Then enter the name of the user you want (with or without the @).If they have a lot of followers it will take a few hours.(And it’ll keep updating after that, so the data is always fresh)
 
 Meanwhile you can use other tools to view the data, download it to Excel and more.For example, using the “Summarise this data” tool, this is what the people who follow @samuelpepys are into in their Twitter bios.</p>
