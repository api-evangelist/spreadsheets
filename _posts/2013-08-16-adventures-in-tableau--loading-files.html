<p>Tableau is a widely used visualisation tool, particularly in the business intelligence area. It grew out of the Polaris project at Stanford University, subtitled “interactive database visualisation”.This is worth bearing in mind since it is the context in which Tableau deals with data.It anticipates that the data you are interested in comes in the form of database tables which has a downside in terms of flexibility for the data it can import and an upside in terms of connecting tables of data in the form of conventional database joins.The ScraperWiki platform makes a nice fit with Tableau since we specialise in sourcing and offering up cleaned data whilst Tableau specialises in visualising clean data; we’ve found it to be a powerful tool in this respect.</p>
