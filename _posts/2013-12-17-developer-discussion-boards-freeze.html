<p>There are some exciting changes coming to the Developer Discussion Boards this week, but first we’re going to need to ask your patience for a bit as we freeze our existing boards and ready migration to the new site.Beginning at 5pm PST on Wednesday, December 18th, we’ll freeze the discussion boards and no new posting will be possible.You’ll still be able to review the existing content as needed, but no user will be able to post new topics or respond to existing topics.During this freeze we encourage you to check out the Salesforce StackExchange or post on twitter with the #askforce hash tag, which many of our developer evangelists and Force.com MVPs monitor.</p>
