<p>KimonoApp style editor: Customize the look and feel of your KimonoApp with app builder’s new style editor.Try it by creating a New KimonoApp or change the style of your existing KimonoApps to give it any flavor you want.Historical data: From today, your APIs will store historical data.Retrieve past versions of your kimono API data by passing an additional version path parameter to the API endpoint.Each time kimono gets data from the source, a new version is created and stored.</p>
