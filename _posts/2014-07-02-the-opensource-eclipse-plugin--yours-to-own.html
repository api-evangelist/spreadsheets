<p>For the last year and a half, we’ve been promising that the Eclipse plug-in for platform development would be released as open-source.We get questions at least once a month asking if we still plan to follow through with that promise.Your long wait is over.This week, we released a new version of the Eclipse plug-in.We are making the source code for this new version public.</p>
