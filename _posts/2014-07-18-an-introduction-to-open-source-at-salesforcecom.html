<p>Written by Ian Varley – July ‘14.This is based on a presentation from Dreamforce ’13 of the same name.Whether you realize it or not, you use open-source software every day.You’re using it right now, in fact–significant chunks of the web run on open-source software, including this blog (which runs on WordPress).“Open source” means that the source code for the software program is a matter of public record, rather than a secret held by one person or company.</p>
