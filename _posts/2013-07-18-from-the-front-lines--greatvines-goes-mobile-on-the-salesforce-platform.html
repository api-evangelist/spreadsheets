<p>Almost everywhere you look today, there is demand for mobile apps in the enterprise.People expect data to be as accessible in the workplace as it is in their personal life.In my conversations with ISVs, I challenge people to think of a situation where mobile does not apply.GreatVines is a longstanding salesforce.com partner who delivers order management for the Beverage Alcohol industry.</p>
