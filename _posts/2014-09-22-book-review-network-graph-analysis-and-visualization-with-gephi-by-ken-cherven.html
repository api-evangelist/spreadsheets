<p>I generally follow the rule that if I haven’t got anything nice to say about something then I shouldn’t say anything at all.Network Graph Analysis and visualization with Gephi by Ken Cherven challenges this principle.Gephi is a system for producing network visualisations, as such it doesn’t have a great many competitors.Fans of Unix will have used Graphviz for this purpose in the past but Gephi offers greater flexibility in a more user-friendly package.Graph theory and network analysis have been growing in importance over the past few years in part because of developments in the analysis of various complex systems using network science.</p>
