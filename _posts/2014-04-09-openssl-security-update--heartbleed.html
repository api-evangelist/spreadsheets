<p>The Restlet Operations team immediately started analyzing its implications: our AWS Elastic Load Balancers (ELB) used for APISpark were our main infrastructure component at risk.Amazon has now fully fixed its ELBs and communicated the procedure for their customers to renew the SSL certificates.We have now completed the renewal of our SSL certificates for both APISpark.com and APISpark.net.</p>
