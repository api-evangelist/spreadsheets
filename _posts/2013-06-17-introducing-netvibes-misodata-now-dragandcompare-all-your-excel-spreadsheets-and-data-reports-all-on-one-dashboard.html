<p>Most employees report spending too much time gathering manual reports from different systems and departments, without being able to find what they need when they need it.Today, we introduced a new technology called MisoData that makes it easy to instantly compare any internal data or KPI–alongside external social trends–just by dragging and dropping.“MisoData begins where Excel ends.Now you can see all your reports on one dashboard, watch every chart update automatically, and drag-and-compare anything.You can literally see how your Sales correlate to your Social Media campaign, Supply Chain and Engineering Tickets,” said Freddy Mini, CEO Netvibes.</p>
