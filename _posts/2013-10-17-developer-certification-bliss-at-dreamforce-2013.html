<p>This year’s DevZone is the best yet for developers who are pursuing Force.com certification at any level.With a variety of workshops, trainings, and sessions focused on helping you walk away from Dreamforce knowing what you need to do to get on the path to certification.Just as a reminder, the developer certification path includes Developer, Advanced Developer, and Technical Architect certification, in other words all of the blue badges in the figure above.For details on each of these, you’ll want to visit the salesforce.</p>
