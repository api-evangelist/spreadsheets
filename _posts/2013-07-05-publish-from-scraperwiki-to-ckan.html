<p>Since its first launch ScraperWiki has worked closely with the Open Data community.Today we’re building on this commitment by pre-announcing the release of the first in a series of tools that will enable open data activists to publish data directly to open data catalogues.To make this even easier, ScraperWiki will also be providing free datahub accounts for open data projects.This first tool will allow users of CKAN catalogues (there are 50, from Africa to Washington) to publish a dataset that has been ingested and cleaned on the new ScraperWiki platform.It’ll be released on the 11th July.</p>
