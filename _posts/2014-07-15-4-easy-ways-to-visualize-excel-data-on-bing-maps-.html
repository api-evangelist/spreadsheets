<p>I have been helping developers visualize their data on Bing Maps for many years.One of the most requests I’ve had in the past is, “I have this data, but can you show it on a map?” More often than not this data would be sitting in an Excel file, usually with some address data, but rarely contained any coordinate information.To get this data into Bing Maps I would geocode the address information and then convert the data into a format that could be easily imported into Bing Maps.This usually required a few hours of work on my part and usually led to a discussion on how this could be turned into a reusable business intelligence app.</p>
