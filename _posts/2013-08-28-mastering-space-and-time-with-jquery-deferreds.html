<p>Recently Zarino and I were pairing on making improvements to a new scraping tool on ScraperWiki.We were working on some code that allows the person using the tool to pick out parts of some scraped data in order to extract a date into a new database column.For processing the data on the server side we were using a little helper library called scrumble which does some cleaning in Python to produce dates in a standard format.Which is great for server-side, but we also needed to display a preview of the cleaned dates to the user, before it’s finally sent to the server for processing.Rather than rewrite this Python code in JavaScript we thought we’d make a little script which could be called using the ScraperWiki exec endpoint to do the conversion for us on the server side.</p>
