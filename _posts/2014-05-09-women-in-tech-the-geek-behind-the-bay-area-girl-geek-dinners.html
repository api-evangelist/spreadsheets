<p>This series highlights women developers, as a way to raise their visibility and hopefully break down some of the unconscious biases that block the path of women and people of color when it comes to technology jobs.This week, I take a look inside salesforce.com at someone who is delivering Salesforce1 Platform Administration tools and making an impact in the Women in Tech community.I encourage you to share these stories, and your own, with someone who doesn’t “fit” the stereotype of a programmer.In this small way, we can change the ratio.</p>
